# JavaScript and Classes
Yes, JavaScript does have classes, but it's important to understand that JavaScript's class system is based on prototypes rather than traditional class-based inheritance systems found in languages like Java or Python.
JavaScript introduced the class syntax in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it easier for developers familiar with class-based languages to work with JavaScript. However, under the hood, JavaScript's classes are still primarily syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance.

## OOPs

## Object
 -> Collection of properties and methods
 -> toLowerCase and many more

## Why use OOPs
 -> Actually we dont need OOPs in JavaScript but codes are getting messed up and there's a concept of Spaghetti code,from OOPs we can use many features of Java too like services.

## Parts of OOPs
 -> Object Literal -- Iska mtlb literally hi hai agr mai 2 bol rha to 2 hi hai

## Constructor function

## Prototype(Proto)

## Instances(new,this keyword)

## Four Pillars of OOPs
Abstraction -> Details hide kr lena (Ex- fetch())
Encapsulation -> Encapsulate ,wrap up and access
Inheritance -> 
Polymorphism -> Poly -> many ,morphism->forms
